```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(rvest) 

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6, 
  out.width = "90%"
  )

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis", 
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d 

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")) 
```

## Get started 

We're going to write some functions. 

Here's z-scores: 
```{r}
x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 4, sd = 2.3)
x_again = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 6, sd = .3)

(x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
(x_again - mean(x_again)) / sd(x_again)
```

Now let's write a function: 
```{r}
## we're calling it the "z_score function" 
## it's a function of the variable x and the stuff that's going to be in the body of the function is in between these open curly brackets {}
## z_score is now going to be an object and that object is going to be a function 
## the argument into that function is something we're calling "x," also known as the "x argument into the function" 

z_score = function(x) {
  
  (x - mean(x)) / sd(x) 
  
}

## if you go into the environment tab, we can see there's now a "z_score function" 
```

Let's try out the function:  
```{r}

```
